# I. Intended user experience 

**-Intended Use Sequence:**

1.  User enters the first number (A) by sequentially pressing each
    number, starting with the most significant digit. It is displayed.

2.  The user selects an operation using the keymap below.

3.  The user enters the second number (B) in the same manner as A. He
    may press clear once to clear B. Pressing clear twice in a row
    starts over by clearing A and B, and returning to Step 1.

4.  The user presses equal to view the final result. He may press clear
    to return to Step 1 with a blank slate for the next calculation. If
    he wants to repeat the last operation, he may press equal again as
    many times as he wants.

Constant Features: The Basys' LED 0 is lit up when A is being displayed,
and LED 1 is lit when B is displayed, to help keep track of the process.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Limitations**

1.  The Basys3 FPGA only has a four digit seven segment display.
    Therefore, the max displayable number is 9999.

2.  This is a positive integer calculator. Fractional and negative
    numbers are not supported. The lowest display is 0000.

3.  If the limit (9999) is exceeded, the result rolls over, except in
    the case of exponent where it is not calculated.

4.  Any number divided by 0 is said to be 0000. Ideally we would crash
    the universe, but further research is needed.

**High Level Notes:** When a button is pressed, Handler reads it from
the keyboard. If it's a digit (0-9), it notifies the FSM via
*Smoothed_Button* (0-9) and *button_pressed* (monopulsed notification
bit), which then tells the datapath to take it into the correct number
(A or B). If it's an operation (inputed after A), the FSM stores it from
*operator_pressed* (A-F) and, when equals is pressed, tells the Datapath
to carry out the correct operation via one of six signals (*add_en,
sub_en, etc., monopulsed*). All along the way, the FSM is telling the
Datapath which number (A or B) the user ought to see via *sel_disp*.
This is sent to the display module which converts four digit BCD
(0000-9999) to the electrical signals the seven segment display needs.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was one of the tricker parts of this project! Check out exactly how
the keyboard hardware works here:

[**[https://digilent.com/reference/\_media/reference/pmod/digilent-pmod-interface-specification.pdf]{.underline}**](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/pmod/digilent-pmod-interface-specification.pdf)

This means our handler has some funky processing to do. Here's how I
handled that:

Handler has a clock divider that changes Col every 1ms, from "0111" -\>
"1011" -\> "1101" -\> "1110" to read each column. That's great, but it's
only reading a pressed button Â¼ of the time, so a held '5' would go from
low to high, high to low over and over again. How do we differentiate
between a continuous hold, and a new press? To each button pressed, an
additional bit (lovingly called 'flopper') is appended. When no release
is detected, flopper stays the same. When a release is detected (all
rows are "1111," as measured by 'held' = '0000'), flopper is flipped
(0-\>1, 1-\>0), but the appended bit on the previous number stays the
same. Therefore, when the next '5' is pressed on the keyboard, the
flopper appended is the opposite value. That tells a process constantly
comparing curr_button and last_button that it really is a different
press, even though both are fives! The flopvalues are different. Then,
we can truncate curr_button back to '5' (0101) to send it to the rest of
the calculator. See this nifty chart! The appended flopper is the
underlined first digit.

**State Machine**![](media/media/image7.png){width="3.373837489063867in"
height="4.317708880139983in"}

![](media/media/image12.png){width="5.365403543307087in"
height="4.214966097987752in"}

It's a very classic state machine, except the stored operator input
(Add, Subtract, etc.) affects which of the following signals is
monopulsed in the DoOp stage: *add_en, sub_en, mult_en, div_en, exp_en,
modd_en*. For instance, operator_pressed = '1010' and advanced_switch
='1' eventually results in *exp_en* being monopulsed because A in
advanced mode is coded as the exponent operation. *A_overwrite*
overwrites all of A's digits from the operate block, while *A_en/B_en*
only takes in one digit and shifts the rest.

**Datapath**

![](media/media/image6.png){width="9.0in" height="3.4305555555555554in"}

The datapath is composed of three sub-blocks: two numbers (A,B) and a
block to perform different functions on them (operation_logic). The
output of the operation overwrites all the digits of the first number
inputted (A) since it is no longer needed. B is potentially necessary
for sequential operations. The correct number (A or B) is outputted to
the display.

Here's a breakdown of the two files (number and operate_logic):

> ![](media/media/image9.png){width="3.5416666666666665in"
> height="2.3958333333333335in"}

**Inside number**, a 4x4 regfile stores 4 BCD digits. When overwrite is
high, Overwrite_Data replaces all four digits. When en is high, the
digits shift upwards and Button\[3:0\] is fed into the lowest
significant digit. For instance, if *en* goes high when *button* is 5
and the current regfile is 9786, then the updated regfile becomes 7865.
This allows for a user to sequentially input a number.

![](media/media/image13.png){width="3.3541666666666665in"
height="3.9270833333333335in"}

**Inside operate_logic**, A_BCD and B_BCD are converted to binary. These
are then cast to integers to asynchronously calculate signals for their
sum, difference, product, quotient, and mod. The calculation process for
exponent is different, though. A 14x16 regfile stores 14 numbers that
sequentially cascade the multiplication operation. The first is
always 1. The second becomes A. The third becomes A\*A. the fourth
becomes A\*A\*A, etc. Every clock cycle, one of the indexes is updated,
and after 13 clock cycles it becomes up to date. Luckily, we found it
impossible to press '=' in 0.13 Î¼-seconds. If someone knows the Flash
please put us in contact for further testing. B determines the index of
the requested power. All of these outcomes are muxed by each en input (
*add_en, sub_en, mult_en, div_en, exp_en, modd_en*) into C, which is
then converted back to BCD and outputted.

# IV. Testing

The main logical functionality of the calculator lies in the interaction
between the datapath and state machine, which I have called the core.
The keyboard hardware and electrical outputs create unintuitive and
unnecessary layers of complexity, and can be modeled separately.
Therefore, in these core simulations, I have directly inputted the
output of Input_Handler, and observed the BCD output.

Here is a multiplication operation: 96x8 = 768. You can track the FSM
states progress from taking in each digit of A, taking in the single
digit of B, and finally doing the operation. In addition, the BCD
display shows A, B, and then the answer (from A again).

![](media/media/image11.png){width="8.57638888888889in"
height="3.1268088363954507in"}

Similarirly, the Datapath displays the correct output on BCD_display,
and is outputting the correct result, 768.

All of the other standard operations result in completely identical
testbenches, only where the output is changed. The one interesting case
is exponent, for the reasons documented above. Here is another
simulation showcasing the cascading regfile for 2\^6 = 64:

![](media/media/image10.png){width="9.0in" height="3.138888888888889in"}

Since A was raised to the power of 6, exp_reg\[6\] was outputted even
though 128, 256. 512...etc. were also calculated. exp_count determines
which index of the regfile is updated. Note A_switch is high since we
are in advanced mode! The FSM is taking in operator_mode and A_switch
correctly, and interpreting it properly as the exponent function.

The other main testbench was for the Input Handler. Note that it's
extremely hard to simulator because divider theoretically requires
100000 clock cycles to active Col for the first time! I helped this by
having divider increment by 10 instead of 1, but it's still a big
simulation.

Here, a button is pressed (1). That's because 0111 is sent out to read
the first column, and 0111 read is the first row. As you can see,
Smoothed_Button is updated, and button_pressed is monopulsed. Huzzah!

Next, here's when an operator is pressed. Here, Smoothed_Button is
updated, but button_pressed isn't monopulsed, because 'F' is not a
number. Instead, operator_pressed is monopulsed as a four bit bus.
Huzzah x2!

We didn't test the 7seg file because it was provided to us in lab 5, and
worked instantly from the start. Plus, its anode and rolling segment
outputs would be pretty intensive to interpret, especially when it's
just for another report. So let's move on to the number subcomponent of
the datapath.

Here is a test of the number subcomponent:
![](media/media/image5.png){width="9.0in" height="0.8194444444444444in"}

As you can see, the digits 3,7,6, and 5 are sequentially pressed. When
en is monopulsed, they are rotated into the Value. Eventually, that
number becomes 3675. Perfect! Then, 9999 is overwritten, and value
updates accordingly. That's all, folks!

Here is a test of the operation subcomponent:
![](media/media/image8.png){width="9.0in" height="2.6805555555555554in"}

It's synchronously adding 19 and 3, to get a result of 22, which is
outputed when add_en goes high! You can see the conversion to binary in
A/B_binary from A/nB_BCD. The output is C_BCD. Note some other signals
aren't calculated because their enable switches haven't triggered their
processes yet.

For further testing and more in-depth edge cases, check out the demo
video. Just pressing the buttons is a lot quicker and more intuitive
than writing up a VHDL testbench!

Reflections and wishes:

Jake: What a ride it's been! I've gone from not knowing what in
tarnation a flip-flop is to coding a calculator on an FPGA. Fun! The
hardest part was definitely blocking out the design, assigning
functionality to each section, and deciding on which signals to pass
where. I'm a CS major so the coding was pretty easy. That being said, I
did learn that for loops in VHDL are massively nerfed because of how a
process works: the same variable can't be updated iteratively because it
only changes at the end of the process! This property is unfortunate for
the exponential function. Luckily, the work-around was pretty easy, and
I could still use a for loop when going through regfile indexes. If I
had another week or so to work on this project, I'd probably clean up
the interaction between the Input Handler and the FSM. It'd be super
easy to have the Input Handler put out a monopulsed button press for
ever single button 0-F, and have the FSM check if it's an operator or
not. That seems much cleaner than differentiating that beforehand and
running three separate signals across. Plus, it makes the Input Handler
more modular for other projects. Also, I could also have the datapath
store the operation mode! I stored it in the FSM because I thought I'd
code in different states for add_op, sub_op, etc., but that's completely
unnecessary. In the future, I would store the operation mode in the
datapath, and get rid of the six operation enable lines. That'd make the
RTL diagram much cleaner and eliminate memory from the datapath.In
addition, I'd've liked to add negative numbers, decimals, and numbers
greater than 9999. I think having big numbers scroll across the screen
like a stadium billboard would be pretty cool, but scientific notation
is also possible.

Alek: Between the brainstorm, RTL, Coding, Simulating, and Hardware
Implementation portions of this project, my mastery of modular
organization was continuously tested. As a language, VHDL is incredibly
unique in its compilation and structure and much, much different than
any other programming language I know. Due to this difference in
structure, it made the debugging process very difficult initially as I
was forced to do much more on my end to debug in comparison to a 'higher
up' language such as Python. Getting increasingly adept at finding
these, usually small and hidden, errors across many different connected
modules within this project greatly improved my understanding of how,
beyond Vivado, a project of this design complexity should be broken down
and solved. Working with a partner was also a great experience as it
helped keep the project organized as to divide work flow and keep each
other in check with our vision for each new component. Learning to work
in unison helped produce well 'sculpted' ideas that ended up working in
the long run. All in all, this project was a fantastic learning
experience as it truly tested the mettle of my design-solving process on
a larger scale.

Acknowledgments:

A huge thank you to Tad Truex for teaching everything and being
available for debugging and Vivado navigation. Also a big shout out to
our TA Brandon for all the help and communication. It's been an
intensive project (especially this six part writeup lol), but I've
learned a ton.
